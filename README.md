Example of an overlay that pulls emojis from Discord and allows viewers to use them in chat.

## Building

Get a Discord token, google how to do it

Get the Discord Guild ID, open the Discord in your browser and look for a url like `https://discord.com/channels/1234567890123456789`. That first number in the url is your Guild ID.

Your channel name, you should be able to figure out on your own.

Set values in `.env`

Compile with `npm run build`

## Using the overlay

Set `dist/index.html` as a local file in a Browser Source in OBS
